# The ETHOS open source initiative

[ETHOS (Emerging THreat Open Sharing)](https://www.ethos-org.io) is designed to share real-time information to develop early warning mechanisms for investigating anomalous behavior across a wide range of operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS) environments, rather than sharing data after alerting on known detections and malware signatures. 

General membership applications will be linked here and on [the ETHOS website](https://www.ethos-org.io) in June 2023. Anyone can apply to join the inaugural ETHOS Community and GitHub and begin contributing to the code. The repositories will be fully public after these initial vetted participants build and test a proof of concept which will dictate the criteria for a general availability release.
